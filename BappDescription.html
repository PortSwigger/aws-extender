<p>This extension can identify and test S3 buckets as well as Google Storage buckets and Azure Storage containers for common misconfiguration issues.</p>

<p>You can enter AWS keys or GS keys from your management console to do through tests. The extension will still provide minimal functionality (e.g., identifying buckets) even if none of the above requirements are satisfied.</p>
